        I SUPPORT JAMAICA is a project which seeks to provide an easy and creative way for Jamaicans in the Diaspora and elsewhere and friends of Jamaica to provide financial support to projects, both microenterprise and nonprofit, that the JN Small Business Loans Ltd. consider worthy and reliable. Jamaicans are known for their indomitable spirit in business, sports, music and any other area they choose to become involved in. As Benjamin Disraeli said, "The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes." Unfortunately, this opportunity tends to hinge on the catalyst of money, and thousands of small entrepreneurs are unable to realize their true business potential because of their inability to access financing from traditional sources. The inherent perceived risk and the lack of adequate collateral are cited as the primary causes for this problem.<br /><br />
In an attempt to provide a tourniquet for this inherent business practice problem, I SUPPORT's mission is to deliver innovative and accessible credit in a timely and profitable manner to micro and small entrepreneurs in Jamaica who have limited access to loans from traditional banking sources. The objectives of this project are to assist micro entrepreneurs to increase their income and improve the quality of their lives, create new jobs and to support the development of the Jamaican micro enterprise sector.<br /><br />
I SUPPORT also provides a platform for anyone who wishes to donate money to non-profits in Jamaica.<br /><br />                                         </p>
                                           
<h1>Lending to an entrepreneur</h1>
    <p>
The loan process will be simple and rewarding. Persons who give and those who receive will be able to express their appreciation by posting testimonials on the website. This essentially will reflect a good rapport between the demand and supply connection and consequently can lead to additional interest from other persons. Additionally, the entrepreneur will receive a rebate on the last loan payment as an incentive to list on the site.</p>

<h1>Giving to local charities and community groups</h1>
<p>
Social entrepreneurship facilitates the framework for effecting social change by using traditional business practices to gain something more than profit: namely, a better world. I SUPPORT makes it easy for individual philanthropists who want to contribute to worthwhile causes in communities across Jamaica. People around the world will be able to donate to worthy and responsible initiatives located in what could be their home parish, or home town, and will feel a sense of pride in knowing that they have helped Jamaica take a step in the right direction.
In creating this causal link between idea and execution and by extension dreams and funding, I SUPPORT JAMAICA fosters a viable and thriving entrepreneurial spirit that is at the core of the Jamaican social landscape.<br /><br />

I SUPPORT JAMAICA is an initiative of JN Small Business Loans Ltd.</p>
