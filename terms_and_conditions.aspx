            </p>
            <p>
                <span>The Foundation will identify community based projects deserving of 
                funding. The Foundation will assist the Project Sponsors to post a full 
                description and other pertinent details of the Project on the 
                Isupportjamaica.com Web Site. Through the Web site Project Sponsors will solicit 
                grants to fund their Projects. The Foundation will manage the Web Site Grant 
                Link which matches donors with Project Sponsors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p>
                <span>A potential donor will have the opportunity to review the various 
                community projects posted on the Web Site. For each project the minimum target 
                funding (“Target Amount”) will be specified. The Target Amount is the minimum 
                amount sought to be raised to successfully undertake the particular Project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p>
                <span>A donor who identifies a Project to support will make a donation to the 
                Foundation. The Foundation will hold the funds donated and if the Target Amount 
                is achieved within the time stated the Foundation will then disburse the funds 
                to the Project Sponsors. If the Target Amount is not reached within the donation 
                period then donors to that Project will be informed and will have the option to 
                assign their donation to another Project. <o:p></o:p></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Where the Target Amount is not reached within the donation period and the 
                donors have been notified and have not taken the option to assign their donation 
                to another Project within six months of being notified the Foundation reserves 
                the right to assign the donation to another Project or to allocate the donation 
                to assist in offsetting the administrative costs associated with the 
                Isupportjamaica.com initiative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p>
                <span>Donors will have the opportunity to track the progress of their sponsored 
                project via regular e-dates. Subject to the Privacy Policy donors shall be at 
                liberty to grant a testimonial which may be posted on the Web Site or in the 
                Foundation Facebook page or other e-media outlet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                <b><span>Acknowledgement and Agreement of Project Sponsors<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
            <p>
                <span>By submitting a Project for sponsorship on the Isupportjamaica.com Web 
                site each Project Sponsor will be deemed to undertake to the Foundation and to 
                any Donor that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
             <ol type="a">
            <li>(a)	the information provided to the Foundation about the Project is accurate and complete in all material respects;</li>
            <li>donated funds disbursed to the Project Sponsor will be applied solely towards the Project and for no other purpose whatsoever;</li>
            <li>he will keep and maintain accurate and complete accounting records of all project expenditures;</li>
            <li>he will submit such accounting and other records to spot audits, without prior notice, 
                by the Foundation or by any accountant or other agent appointed by the Foundation;</li>
            <li>he will provide regular update of the progress of the Project and after completion 
                regular reports of the utilization and contribution being made by the Project in the 
                community;</li>
            <li>he will provide prompt notice to the Foundation of the occurrence of any event which is 
                likely to adversely affect the smooth implementation and execution of the Project or 
                utilization in the community;</li>
            <li>disbursed funds will not be handled in any corrupt manner and that where third party 
            goods or services have to be acquired such acquisition will be made at the best price 
            reasonably obtainable without favour and free of partisan influences;</li>
            <li>any breach of these terms may result in the Project Sponsor being black-listed and
             each Project Sponsor waives any claim against the Foundation for defamation or otherwise 
             arising form being black-listed and barred from promoting any further Project on the web 
             site unless the Project Sponsor can positively prove that the statement made by the 
             Foundation was known to be untrue but was nevertheless willfully made to deliberately 
             harm the Project Sponsor. </li>

         </ol>
            <p>
                <span>The fact that a Project Sponsor has been black-listed does not necessarily 
                mean that he is guilty of some act of dishonesty. It only signifies that the 
                Project Sponsor has failed to comply with the terms of the sponsorship on the 
                Isupportjamaica.com Web Site. The Foundation reserves the right to continue the 
                promotion of a worthwhile Project under different leadership even though the 
                original Project Sponsor has been black-listed for breach of the terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                <span>The Foundation will endeavour to vet Projects and use reasonable efforts,

                the requisite management and institutional support to ensure that the grant 
                funds are used as intended and that the Project will enure for the benefit of 
                the intended beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the Foundation best efforts it must 
                be recognised that not all projects will succeed. Each Donor acknowledges and 
                agrees as follows:<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

                    <li>that the Foundation gives no guarantee and makes no representation or warranty as to the implementation or execution of any Project;</li>
                    <li>that whilst the Foundation will endeavour to guard against misuse of donated funds it shall not be liable to any donor if a Project Sponsor actually mis-allocates, misuses or appropriates donated funds to non-approved purposes; and</li>
                    <li>that whilst the Foundation will undertake spot checks on a Project it does not have the resources to undertake detailed Project audits.</li>
